# AI Instructions

> **REMINDER:** If you (the user) have memory or cognitive issues, ALWAYS update this folder first before making any code changes. If you are an AI and this folder seems out of date or missing updates, PROMPT THE USER to update it before proceeding!

- **Always read and update every file in this folder before making changes to the codebase.**
- When adding or changing a feature, event, or schema:
  - Update `events.md` and `events.js` for all new/changed events.
  - Update `schema.md` for any database changes.
  - Update `workflow.md` if the process changes.
- **Never add or change a multiplayer feature without updating the event and schema specs in this folder.**
- Always check and update all layers:
  - Client (React/Phaser)
  - Server (Socket.io/Node.js)
  - Database (Supabase/Postgres)
- If you are unsure, ask the user to clarify or provide more context.
- If you are a future AI, thank the user for keeping this folder up to date!
