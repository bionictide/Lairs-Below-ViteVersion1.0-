Client and server share the same event names, ensuring consistency and reducing errors. No local fallback or guessing. All gameplay state is server-driven.

## src/shared/RNG.js

- Migration pattern: All game logic, world state, and event handling are now server-authoritative. Client only emits requests and renders server responses. Player join, room enter, inventory, loot, and dungeon state are all managed and validated on the server. JWT auth is enforced for all connections. No client-side fallback or guessing. All gameplay state is server-driven and persistent. Event flows are request/response, and all state changes are validated and broadcast by the server. Successfully migrated flows include player join, room enter, inventory update, loot bag drop/pickup, and dungeon reset on 0 players.

## server/package.json

- Dependencies: socket.io, dotenv, node-fetch, seedrandom
- All dependencies are required for server-authoritative logic, event handling, environment config, fetch, and deterministic RNG
- Migration pattern: All server logic and event flows rely on these dependencies for secure, consistent, and deterministic multiplayer gameplay

# === MIGRATION OVERLAP/REDUNDANCY NOTES ===

- For all files where logic has already been migrated to shared/server code (e.g., dungeon generation, event names, player join/leave, inventory, loot), do NOT duplicate or re-migrate. Remove or stub out any remaining client code for these systems. Only migrate what is still client-side and not yet server-authoritative.

## src/DungeonService.js
- NOTE: All dungeon generation, world state, and room logic is now handled by shared/dungeoncore.js and server/server.js. Do NOT re-migrate. Remove all local state and logic except for rendering and UI. Only use server payloads.

## src/shared/dungeoncore.js
- NOTE: Dungeon generation and structure is already server-authoritative and shared. Do NOT duplicate or re-migrate. Client only renders based on server data.

## src/shared/events.js
- NOTE: All event names and flows are now defined centrally and used by both client and server. Do NOT duplicate or hard-code event names elsewhere. Only use these shared definitions.

## server/server.js
- NOTE: All game logic, world state, and event handling are server-authoritative. Do NOT attempt to migrate these flows again from the client. Only migrate remaining client logic not yet server-authoritative.

## src/socket.js
- NOTE: Player join, room enter, and related flows are already migrated to request/response with the server. Do NOT duplicate or re-migrate. Only emit actions and handle server responses as implemented.

## src/RoomManager.js, src/PlayerStats.js, src/BagManager.js, src/EncounterManager.js, src/CombatVisuals.js, src/HealthBar.js, src/HintManager.js, src/ItemManager.js, src/LootUIManager.js, src/NPCLootManager.js, src/PuzzleManager.js, src/ShelfManager.js, src/SpellManager.js, src/TreasureManager.js
- NOTE: Only migrate logic that is still client-side and not yet server-authoritative. Remove or stub out any local state, logic, or event handling that overlaps with already-migrated server/shared systems.
